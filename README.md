# WireGuard VPN with Multi-IP Exit Routing

Deploy WireGuard and AmneziaWG VPN servers with per-client exit IP routing.

## Features

- **awg-easy** — wg-easy v15 in AmneziaWG mode (obfuscated WireGuard) with web UI
- **wg-easy** — Standard WireGuard with web UI
- **Multi-IP exit routing** — Route different clients through different external IPs
- **Persistent client assignments** — Survive container restarts
- **Automatic host SNAT** — `host-routing` service manages iptables rules via Docker Compose
- **DPI filtering (nDPI)** — Drop BitTorrent (or other nDPI-classified protocols)
  **per-exit**, via the `xt_ndpi` kernel module + an `xt-ndpi-rules` Compose service

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Multiple external IPs on the host (for multi-IP routing)
- SSH access for admin panel tunneling

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo>
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Custom AmneziaWG port (optional, default 51820; must match the WireGuard
# port set later in the awg-easy web UI)
# AWG_PORT=3127

# Multi-IP routing: gateway:external_ip pairs
# Tables auto-assigned: 100, 101, 102...
EXIT_ROUTES=172.100.0.1:1.2.3.4,172.101.0.1:2.3.4.5
```

Server host, DNS, allowed IPs, the admin account and AmneziaWG obfuscation
params are configured in the awg-easy web UI on first run.

### 2. Configure additional IPs on the host

Add secondary IP to your network interface. Example for netplan (`/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`):

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      addresses:
        - "1.2.3.4/24"
        - "2.3.4.5/24"
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 1.2.3.1
```

Apply: `sudo netplan apply`

### 3. Start containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The `host-routing` service automatically attaches SNAT rules and detaches them on `docker compose down`.

### 4. Access admin panels

Admin panels are bound to localhost. Use SSH tunnels:

```bash
# AmneziaWG (port 51821)
ssh -L 51821:127.0.0.1:51821 user@server

# wg-easy (port 51831)
ssh -L 51831:127.0.0.1:51831 user@server
```

Then open:
- http://localhost:51821 — AmneziaWG
- http://localhost:51831 — WireGuard

## Multi-IP Exit Routing

### How it works

1. Docker networks `exit1` and `exit2` have subnets `172.100.0.0/24` and `172.101.0.0/24`
2. `services/wg-easy/routing-init.sh` creates routing tables inside containers (100, 101, ...)
3. `host-routing` service adds SNAT rules on the host to map subnets to external IPs
4. Per-client routing rules send traffic through specific tables

### Assign a client to exit IP

```bash
# Route client 10.8.0.3 through exit2 network
./assign-exit.sh wg-easy add 10.8.0.3 exit2

# Remove assignment
./assign-exit.sh wg-easy remove 10.8.0.3

# List available networks and current assignments
./assign-exit.sh wg-easy list
```

### Check current SNAT rules

```bash
docker compose exec host-routing sh /app/manage.sh status
```

## DPI filtering — block BitTorrent (and other protocols)

Drop traffic that **nDPI** deep-packet-inspection classifies as a given protocol
(BitTorrent by default) on the VPN exits — this catches **encrypted (MSE/PE)**
torrents and DHT/uTP, not just plaintext or well-known ports. Blocking is
**per-exit**: you choose which exits enforce it.

### How it works

1. **`xt-ndpi-dkms`** — the out-of-tree `xt_ndpi` netfilter kernel module,
   installed on the host via DKMS (auto-rebuilt on kernel upgrades). It provides
   the iptables `-m ndpi` match.
2. **`xt-ndpi-rules`** — a Compose service (host netns, mirrors `host-routing`)
   that applies `-m ndpi --proto <p> -j DROP` to Docker's **`DOCKER-USER`** chain,
   scoped to the chosen exit subnets, and re-applies on Docker restart. It bundles
   the userspace `libxt_ndpi.so` match.

Because VPN traffic is MASQUERADEd to its exit subnet *inside* the container, the
source seen on `DOCKER-USER` is the exit network — so a source-scoped rule acts as
a **per-exit on/off switch**. (`DOCKER-USER` is in `FORWARD`, before host SNAT, so
this composes cleanly with `host-routing`.)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Build the .deb packages (Docker; no root)
./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh build

# 2. Install the host kernel module (DKMS builds xt_ndpi for the running kernel)
sudo ./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh install

# 3. Bring up the rule service (or `docker compose up -d` the whole stack)
docker compose up -d --build xt-ndpi-rules
```

> The `xt-ndpi-rules` image bundles `libxt_ndpi.so` from the `.deb`s, so run
> step 1 (`ndpi-setup.sh build`) before any `docker compose up -d` — otherwise
> that service's image build fails on the missing package.

### Configure

On the `xt-ndpi-rules` service in `docker-compose.yml` (or via `.env`):

```yaml
environment:
  - NDPI_DROP=bittorrent                       # protocols (comma list)
  - NDPI_CHAIN=DOCKER-USER                      # chain to apply rules to
  - NDPI_SOURCE=172.100.0.0/24,172.101.0.0/24   # which exits to enforce on
```

Choose which exits enforce blocking (exit1 = `172.100.0.0/24`, exit2 = `172.101.0.0/24`):

- both exits → `NDPI_SOURCE=172.100.0.0/24,172.101.0.0/24`
- only exit1 → `NDPI_SOURCE=172.100.0.0/24` (exit2 left open)
- all forwarded traffic → `NDPI_SOURCE=` (empty)

Re-apply with `docker compose up -d xt-ndpi-rules`.

### Verify

```bash
./services/xt-ndpi-rules/verify.sh   # end-to-end checks (no sudo, all via docker compose)
docker logs xt-ndpi-rules        # "dropping [bittorrent] from [...] on DOCKER-USER"
docker exec xt-ndpi-rules iptables-legacy -nvL DOCKER-USER | grep ndpi   # live counters
```

See [`docs/ndpi.md`](docs/ndpi.md) for the full details.

## Junk packet generator (`awg-junk-gen.py`)

Generates AmneziaWG **I1–I5** special junk packets that are byte-valid **QUIC v1
Initial** packets carrying a real TLS ClientHello. AmneziaWG sends them before the
WireGuard handshake, so the first thing a DPI box sees on the UDP flow is an
ordinary HTTP/3 connection attempt.

Requires `pip install cryptography`.

### Generate

```bash
# One packet, default SNI (bag.itunes.apple.com)
./awg-junk-gen.py

# Pick the hostname the packet appears to connect to
./awg-junk-gen.py --sni cdn.jsdelivr.net

# Three packets for I1, I2, I3
./awg-junk-gen.py --sni www.microsoft.com --count 3
```

Output is ready to paste:

```
I1 = <b 0xc60000000108589ec1b628078cc30000449e0bec2f18...>
I2 = <b 0xc60000000108b3a1a3ef41ed4e5d0000449e9b790755...>
```

### Use it

Put the lines in the `[Interface]` section of the config — **server and client
must carry identical I1–I5 values**, or the handshake never completes. In this
stack the obfuscation params are set in the awg-easy web UI (see
[Quick Start](#1-clone-and-configure)), which propagates them into generated
client configs.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `--sni` | `bag.itunes.apple.com` | Hostname advertised in the ClientHello |
| `--alpn` | `h3` | Comma-separated ALPN list |
| `--count` | `1` | Packets to emit (`I1`, `I2`, …) |
| `--size` | `1200` | Datagram size in bytes |
| `--param` | `I` | Config key prefix (`I` or `J`) |
| `--start` | `1` | First parameter index |
| `--template` | built-in | Clone the fingerprint of your own capture |
| `--format` | `awg` | `awg` / `hex` / `raw` |

Every packet is self-checked before printing: the script decrypts its own output
the way a DPI engine would and aborts if the observed SNI doesn't match.

The built-in ClientHello template is from an iOS HTTP/3 request, so the JA3/JA4
fingerprint reads as an Apple client. `--template file.hex` takes a raw
ClientHello or a full captured Initial packet (as `<b 0x…>`, `0x…` or bare hex)
and clones that fingerprint instead.

### Caveats

- **`<b 0x…>` is a literal byte string**, so one generated packet is replayed
  verbatim on every handshake for that config. What this buys you is a blob
  nobody else is using — unlike one copied from a forum post — plus the ability
  to rotate. It does not make each handshake unique on the wire.
- Pick an SNI plausible for your server's hosting; a CDN hostname is usually
  safer than a first-party domain, since CDN IP space is broad and shared.
- I1–I5 need AmneziaWG **1.5+** on both ends. Older builds silently lack them
  (the `amneziawg-dkms` 1.0.0 kernel module, for instance, has no I-packet
  support even though `awg set` lists the keys).

## Ports

| Service              | Port           | Protocol | Description          |
|----------------------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| awg-easy (AmneziaWG) | AWG_PORT/udp  | WG       | VPN tunnel           |
| awg-easy (AmneziaWG) | 51821/tcp     | HTTP     | Admin panel (local)  |
| wg-easy  (WireGuard) | WG_PORT/udp   | WG       | VPN tunnel           |

## Troubleshooting

### VPN connected but no internet

1. Check container logs: `docker compose logs awg-easy`
2. Verify routing tables: `docker exec awg-easy ip route show table 100`
3. Check SNAT rules: `docker compose exec host-routing sh /app/manage.sh status`

### Client not using expected exit IP

1. Verify assignment: `./assign-exit.sh awg-easy list`
2. Check rule inside container: `docker exec awg-easy ip rule show`
3. Toggle VPN on client to force new connection
