# Block BitTorrent through the VPN (nDPI / xt_ndpi)

Drops BitTorrent traffic transiting the VPN using **nDPI deep packet
inspection**. Detection is flow-based, so it catches **encrypted (MSE/PE)**
torrents and DHT/uTP — not just plaintext handshakes or well-known ports.

> **Target:** Ubuntu 24.04. The `xt_ndpi` kernel module ships as a DKMS package
> (see [`../ndpi`](../ndpi)); DKMS builds it against the running kernel and
> rebuilds it **automatically** on kernel upgrades.

## How it works

```
VPN client ──▶ wg0 (inside container) ──▶ MASQUERADE (inside container)
          ──▶ docker bridge ──▶ host FORWARD ──▶ uplink
                                      ▲
                          DOCKER-USER chain: -m ndpi --proto bittorrent -j DROP
```

Two pieces, split by what can be containerized:

- **`xt_ndpi.ko` — on the host** (`xt-ndpi-dkms`). A kernel module can't live in
  a container; DKMS builds it against the host kernel and auto-loads it at boot.
- **The DROP rule — the `xt-ndpi-rules` compose service.** A `network_mode:
  host` container (mirroring `host-routing`) that bundles `libxt_ndpi.so` and
  runs `manage.sh attach`/`detach` to add/remove the `-m ndpi` rule on the
  host's **`DOCKER-USER`** chain — the supported hook for user rules, not
  flushed on container restart. It must be a Debian/Ubuntu image (the glibc
  `libxt_ndpi.so` can't load under Alpine/musl).

The rule (which protocols, which chain) is service config in
`docker-compose.yml` — `NDPI_DROP` / `NDPI_CHAIN` — not a host file.

## Install

```bash
# 1. Build the .deb packages (no root needed)
./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh build            # -> ../ndpi/artifacts/*.deb

# 2. Install the host kernel module (DKMS builds + auto-loads xt_ndpi)
sudo ./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh install

# 3. Bring up the rule service (builds its image from the iptables .deb)
docker compose up -d --build xt-ndpi-rules
```

`build` produces `xt-ndpi-dkms` (installed on the host) and `xt-ndpi-iptables`
(its `libxt_ndpi.so` is baked into the `xt-ndpi-rules` image). The nDPI revision
is pinned in [`../ndpi/NDPI_REF`](../ndpi/NDPI_REF); override per build with
`NDPI_REF=<tag|commit> ./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh build`.

## Configure the rule

On the `xt-ndpi-rules` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - NDPI_CHAIN=DOCKER-USER     # chain to apply rules to
  - NDPI_DROP=bittorrent       # comma-separated nDPI protocols to drop
```

Change it (e.g. `NDPI_DROP=bittorrent,tor`) and `docker compose up -d
xt-ndpi-rules` to re-apply.

## Maintenance — kernel upgrades

Nothing to do. DKMS rebuilds `xt_ndpi` for the new kernel automatically on
upgrade (via `/etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms`), so it keeps loading across reboots.

## Verify it's working

```bash
sudo ./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh status          # module + package + service
docker logs xt-ndpi-rules                        # "dropping [bittorrent] on DOCKER-USER"

# rule counters should climb while a test torrent runs:
sudo iptables -n -L DOCKER-USER -v --line-numbers | grep ndpi
```

Functional test: connect a client to the VPN, start a well-seeded torrent
(e.g. a Linux ISO), confirm peers fail to connect / transfer stalls. nDPI
classifies a flow after its first few packets, so the very first packets of
each connection pass before the flow is tagged — the connection still dies,
it's just not a packet-1 block.

> **Backend note:** the service uses `iptables-legacy` (what `xt_ndpi` was
> validated against). It must match the backend dockerd uses for `DOCKER-USER`;
> a legacy/nft mismatch silently no-ops the rule.

## Remove

```bash
docker compose down xt-ndpi-rules          # detaches the rule, stops the service
sudo ./setup-host/ndpi-setup.sh uninstall  # unloads + purges the kernel module
```

## Commands (`ndpi-setup.sh`)

| Command     | Action                                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build`     | Build the `.deb` packages with Docker Compose (no root)       |
| `install`   | Install `xt-ndpi-dkms` (the host kernel module)               |
| `status`    | Show package / module / rule-service state                    |
| `uninstall` | Unload and purge the kernel module                            |

The rule itself is brought up/down with `docker compose up/down xt-ndpi-rules`.
